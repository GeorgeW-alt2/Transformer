## A Profound Dedication

A ramification of the innumerable Omnipotent fragrances of life that I've smelt by the grace of God-I'm grateful to him for enlightening me about his chapters of invincible creation and considering me worthy enough to describe his unparalleled splendor, in a few words and in the shape of this book. A salient tribute to his undefeated power.

## Prologue

The compilation of poems depicts the Omniscient Creator in his infinite unconquerable shapes and forms. Goes to irrefutably prove that there is just one Creator, you choose to call him by whatever name-and for everyone one of us till the time we live. This book is a perpetual dedication to Almighty Lord. It quintessentially portrays the splendor of the Almighty Creator in his infinite forms. Goes to victoriously prove at every step, that no matter how hard the devil tries to annihilate the planet-an inconspicuous tap of the Lord's finger makes him crumble to his very last non-existent frigid roots.

## About the Book

Poems depicting the 'Omnipotent' glory of the Creator in an infinite forms that the poet could ever conceive. Natural and uninhibited outpourings of the heart these poems transport the reader into a world of spirituality and  
magnificence of Godhead. Every poetic piece shows Parekh's unparalleled love for the Almighty and immortalizes the Omnipresent aura of the Lord in a boundless ways and shapes. This spiritually enriched compendium of poems is for all those who've timelessly admired the miraculous prowesses and powers of God at each stage of their lives. Those who've lived each instant of their lives worshipping his Omniscient grace irrespective of the most murderous hell descending around. The poetic imagery brilliantly transcends over every inhibition of caste, creed, color and religion and goes to perpetually prove that all living beings are one and blessed in his fathomless sacrosanct light of truth. The poems depict Parekh's oneness in mind, body and spirit with the Creator.

1. GOD HIMSELF

He whom you can explicitly see is not God,

And he who was the strongest; without the most minuscule form appearing even in flaming sunlight; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you can profoundly feel is not God,

And he who was entirely ungraspable; without even leaving an untidy footprint after majestically traversing on soil; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you could magnificently create is not God,

And he who exists in an incomprehensibly fathomless myriad of forms; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you can profusely imagine is not God,

And he who remains perpetually obscure even after floating in each particle of the exotic atmosphere; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you can vividly dream about is not God,

And he who propelled every brain to think beyond corridors of the unbelievably extraordinary; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you can coin your destiny with is not God,

And he who was maneuvering the lives of boundless at the mere tip of his little finger; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you can cremate is not God,

And he who was immortally living; since unprecedented centuries ago even before this earth was created; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you can admire is not God,

And he who was bestowing an everlasting labyrinth of beauty every unfurling second; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you can wholeheartedly cry for is not God,

And he who was incessantly replacing tears of all mankind with omnipresent smiles; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you can bid a celestial adieu is not God,

And he who was spawning countless for every entity withering; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you can fabulously describe is not God,

And he was all Omniscient; having already embodied the scriptures of holy tomorrow even before the world had begun; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but

God himself .

He whom you can devotedly chant till times beyond eternity is not God,

And he who irrefutably steered every lip on this globe; to propagate the essence of benevolent existence; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you can belligerently fight for is not God,

And he who evolved the most marvelously wonderful species of creation called "Man"; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you perpetually kept close to your chest was not God,

And he who made every single heart throb for the person it loved; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

He whom you witnessed blossoming was not God,

And he who stood taller than the Sun; to illuminate every miserably darkened cranny of trembling soil; was not one of God's infinite disciples; but God himself .

### 2. ALLAH

He was the one who maneuvered my tongue; bestowed upon me the ability to eloquently speak,

He was the one who made me smile; emphatically displaying my armory of white teeth to the world,

He was the one who produced empathy in my eyes; made them profoundly glisten in the morning light,

He was the one who made me rambunctiously chatter; bounce in the true fervor of life,

He was the one who made me sneeze; burst into infinite chortles of uninhibited laughter,

He was the one who engendered me to sweat; tremble innocuously with infinite goose bumps creeping up inadvertently on my naked skin,

He was the one who made me dream; fantasize to the most bizarre limits of contemplation,

He was the one who enabled me to traverse on earth; put my feet firmly on the black soil I tread,

He was the one who made me blush a perfect crimson; as I inevitably winked at a mesmerizing girl,

He was the one who imparted me the skill to voraciously read; pen down intricate lines of exquisite calligraphy,

He was the one who impregnated awesome strength in my knuckles; granted them the tenacity to defend the infirm,

He was the one who made me decipher the minutest of noise; wholesomely relish the blend of tingling sounds in atmosphere,

He was the one who filled my stomach whenever I felt famished; ensured that the right morsels of food occupied its cavities,

He was the one who embodied in me the exuberance to run; inhaling gallons of revitalizing air into my lungs,

He was the one who taught me to judiciously discern between the good and bad; curtail myself from indulging into the nefarious and licentious,

He was the one who waded all circumspection from my mind; whenever I felt besieged by a host of inexplicable dilemmas,

He was the one who instilled astronomical courage in my demeanor; made me stand tall and unflinching against all barricades that confronted me in my way,

He was the one who made me nostalgic; reminisce profoundly the poignant memories of my childhood in my mothers lap,

He was the one who found me the love of my life; made sure that it consolidated into sacrosanct marriage,

He was the one who resurrected my faith in life every unfurling minute; made me imbibe the true spirit of existence,

He was the one who was the blood flowing through my veins; the beating of my heart as it throbbed violently in my chest,

And he was the one whom people of varied races christened as "GOD"; " CHRIST"; "BHAGWAN"; "CREATOR"; "ALMIGHTY"; "LORD"; whom I fondly referred today and till the time I existed; as my "ALLAH".

4. 1 GOD

There were several colors in this world; some were as black as the hideous reptile; while some were pearly and sparkling white,

There were several tunes in this world; some were as sweet as the nightingale; while some were as hoarse and discordant as the horse,

There were several seasons in this world; some were as hot as the blistering sun; while some were placid reflections of the serene night,

There were several hair in this world; some were as fiery as flamboyant flames of the fire; while some were honey and golden brown,

There were several fishes in this world; some were as tiny as shells; while some were monstrously huge as the shark,

There were several dwellings in this world; some were as fortified as raw iron; while some were languidly drooping down like the pigeon feather,

There were several eyes in this world; some were sizzling incessantly in unseething passion; while some were as uncouth as dry ice,

There were several cars in this world; some were as swanky as the dungeon full of diamonds; while some had no engine at all,

There were several entities in this world; some were as pretentious as the peacock; while some slept timidly like black mice,

There were several cheek's in this world; some had boundless tufts of black beard; while some were as effeminate as the queen's garden,

There were several waters in this world; some swirling as turbulently as the ocean; while some flowed like molten butter melting down,

There were several smiles in this world; some were as spurious as the cunningly astute businessman; while some were humanitarian and ready to assist at all times,

There were several perfumes in this world; some were as mesmerizing to inhale as the scarlet rose; while some caused you to vomit out the food you had consumed for morning breakfast,

There were several roads in this world; some were blissful carpets of satin to transgress upon; while some were embedded profusely with acrid thorns,

There were several dreams in this world; some were as ghastly as savage massacre; while some were as exotic as heavenly paradise,

There were several clothes in this world; some were as gaudy as the resplendent rainbow; while some were rustically entwined roots,

There were several religions in this world; some believed in burying man after his death; while some charred him to raw ash after he left breath,

There were several languages in this world; some were as primordial as mystical Sanskrit; while some were contemporary and Oriental English,

There were several bodies in this world; some were as tall as the lanky tree; while some hardly grew above the kitchen sink,

And there were several forms of Almighty Lord; some were called "Christ", some "Allah", some "Buddha", some "Bhagwan", but from centuries unprecedented;

since the time this earth of ours evolved; and even before; there has been just one Creator; Just ONE GOD .

5. ONE GOD

It might perhaps take more than an infinite perennially blossoming trees; to make this brutally estranged earth today; a more holistically fantastic paradise to live in and blissfully exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite tantalizingly exuberant nightingales; to make this traumatically lambasted earth today; a more symbiotically compassionate paradise to live in and beautifully exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite magnanimously twinkling stars; to make this miserably sadistic earth today; a more convivially magnetic paradise to live in and synergistically exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite marvelously vivacious rainbows; to make this obnoxiously wretched earth today; a more magnificently royal paradise to live in and unequivocally exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite invincibly overpowering mountains; to make this agonizingly decrepit earth today; a more celestially jubilant paradise to live in and unassailably exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite sensuously bewitching meadows; to make this horrendously dastardly earth today; a more tranquilly enchanting paradise to live in and insuperably exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite romantically bestowing clouds; to make this dreadfully beleaguered earth today; a more holistically vibrant paradise to live in and timelessly exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite vividly boisterous bees; to make this monotonously deadened earth today; a more effulgently mystical paradise to

live in and indefatigably exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite globules of tantalizingly artistic rain; to make this vindictively upbraiding earth today; a more exotically triumphant paradise to live in and tirelessly exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite ubiquitously enthralling roses; to make this mercilessly indiscriminate earth today; a more benevolently harmonious paradise to live in and timelessly exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite rays of the flamboyantly fumigating Sun; to make this truculently satanic earth today; a more enthrallingly euphoric paradise to live in and magically exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite arrows of irrefutably priceless justice; to make this sordidly staggering earth today; a more blazingly patriotic paradise to live in and peerlessly exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite playgrounds of uninhibitedly cavorting honey; to make this disparagingly corrupt earth today; a more fearlessly intrepid paradise to live in and unflinchingly exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite mists of perennially fragrant simplicity; to make this spuriously sanctimonious earth today; a more ecstatically handsome paradise to live in and sensuously exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite fireballs of philanthropic courage; to make this delinquently betraying earth today; a more righteously embracing paradise to live in and regally exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite breaths of indomitably indisputable innocence; to make this cannibalistically murderous earth today; a more miraculously mitigating paradise to live in and eternally exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite beats of pricelessly untainted love; to make this savagely parasitic earth today; a more Omnipotently benign paradise to live in and gregariously exist; once again,

It might perhaps take more than an infinite moments of truthful perseverance; to make this barbarously incarcerating earth today; a more bountifully proliferating paradise to live in and unambiguously exist; once again,

But there has; is; and shall forever be just "One God"; not only controlling every infinitesimal action; not only impregnably monitoring even the most inconspicuous wish of infinite more than the infinite above for this birth; but for an infinite more births of bliss and marvelous blithe .

6. HE WAS EVERY PERSON'S CREATOR

For every bird gruesomely killed; he had the power to create infinite more fledglings,

For every river dried miserably to a trickle; he had the power to create infinite oceans,

For every tree brutally chopped to the ground; he had the power to create infinite forests,

For every eye inadvertently blinded; he had the power to create infinite with sight,

For every satanic night taking a complete stranglehold on light; he had the power to create infinite brilliant days,

For every tongue which was disdainfully dumb; he had the power to create infinite mouths which could speak and shout,

For every iota of currency furtively stolen; he had the power to create infinite banks looming high and handsome till the heavens,

For every couple who was childless and rendered cruelly unable to procreate; he had the power to create infinite more households bustling with a battalion of toddlers,

For every brain that was wholesomely exhausted; he had the power to create infinite intelligent minds,

For every child disastrously orphaned on the streets; he had the power to create infinite families complete in all respects,

For every blade of grass mercilessly trampled; he had the power to create infinite meadows of lush green crop,

For every skeleton lying disdainfully buried under the coffin; he had the power to create infinite bodies; dancing about in robust health and thunderous fervor,

For every scalp that was balder than the egg; he had the power to create infinite strands of shimmering hair,

For every life lost unwittingly during the tumultuous earthquake; he had the power to create infinite more souls as Kings,

For every slave bound wretchedly to gleaming chains; he had the power to create infinite crusaders to break open the shackles,

For every throat that was dangerously thirsty; he had the power to create infinite mouths slavering with excess water,

For every watch that had abruptly relinquished to function; he had the power to create infinite clocks ticking at electric speeds,

For every Albino engulfed entirely with a coat of appalling pink skin; he had the power to create infinite beauties with the most charismatic of flesh,

For every house that had been diabolically pulverized to raw dust during war; he had the power to create infinite palaces; blended profusely with glittering gold and silver,

For every demon wandering at will on this earth; he had the power to create infinite angels to valiantly defend the world,

For every heart pathetically broken; he had the power to create and bind infinite having just taken birth,

His power to create was simply unprecedented; his process of evolution was simply boundless and beyond the most unimaginable degree of comprehension; and that is why he was not only mine; but every person's Almighty Creator .

7. OUR INVINCIBLE CREATOR-SUN GOD

Perpetually blinding me to all hopelessness on this gigantic Universe; as I gaped indefatigably like a new born child; towards its infinite streams of unflinching golden and austere light,

Perpetually blinding me to all depression on this boundless Universe; as I ebulliently galloped under its unrelentingly amber goodness; the invincible scepter of its profoundly royal light,

Perpetually blinding me to all venomousness on this endless Universe; as I unabashedly let each of its unconquerably blazing rays; wondrously kiss and heal my inexplicably fluttering chest and soul,

Perpetually blinding me to all manipulation on this untiring Universe; as I let its miraculously healing rays; blissfully perpetuate into even the most obfuscated ingredient of my blood,

Perpetually blinding me to all ugliness on this fathomless Universe; as all I witnessed was exotic life burgeoning to its royal fullest; through its undyingly mellifluous beams of freshness; and until the last point till where its rays stretched,

Perpetually blinding me to all parasites on this dimensionless Universe; as I inherently relished to honestly perspire and break into a billion droplets of perspiration for my bread; under its fierily untamed and crimson light,

Perpetually blinding me to all inequality on this inscrutable Universe; as I profusely admired the unison of its countless rays into a united mass of compassionate togetherness; before eventually falling

and illuminating the trajectory of earth divine,

Perpetually blinding me to all greed on this limitless Universe; as I earnestly worshipped its unimaginably altruistic goodness; ubiquitously disseminated in the form of victorious light; to even the remotest cranny of morbidly slithering soil,

Perpetually blinding me to all destiny and tawdry magic on this

bewitching Universe; as I learnt to irrefutably sculpt my very own path and life of truth; under the Omnipresent fullness of its philanthropic light,

Perpetually blinding me to all negativity on this undaunted Universe; as I emerged victorious and as the most royal emperor; following the innermost tunes of my heart; under its rays of Omniscient positivity,

Perpetually blinding me to all fear on this unfettered Universe; as each of its divinely undefeated rays; lit lanterns of priceless hope in the wretched blacks of my cowardly eyes; in every direction that I turned under the sky,

Perpetually blinding me to all infidelity on this enamoring Universe; as I wholesomely imbibed that true power was in melodious togetherness; with fingers forever interlocked in the spirit of camaraderie; under its tirelessly roaring inferno of passionate light,

Perpetually blinding me to all hysteria on this unhindered Universe; as each frazzled nerve of my brain celestially savored its euphorically infallible blaze; to forever rise as a civilization of symbiotic newness,

Perpetually blinding me to all balderdash on this ecstatic Universe; as I articulately interweaved every conceivable ingredient of my existence to the hilt of satisfaction; under its eternally subliming shades of dawn,

Perpetually blinding me to all terrorism on this inexhaustible Universe; as all I could sight were the innumerable flames of uninhibited love; under its swelteringly princely rays which coalesced the entire planet into one; irrespective of the baseless boundaries of caste; creed; color or tribe,

Perpetually blinding me to all despairing blackness on this redolent Universe; as I could sight nothing else but unassailably blistering daylight; till even beyond the horizons; under its divinely unbreakable spell,

Perpetually blinding me to all stagnation on this emollient Universe; as till wherever my vision stretched; all I witnessed was freshness proliferating at the speed of light; under its ardently unbridled cosmos of creativity,

Perpetually blinding me to all death on this unshakable Universe; as all that reached my nostrils was the spirit of undyingly blessed and humanitarian existence; under its vivaciously humming rays of eternal freedom,

Was not just singularly mine; not just singularly yours; but unitedly ours and only ours; very very special and majestically invincible Creator; in the form of the brilliant "Sun God".

8. MY CREATOR

For as long as the sun has shone in the cosmos; filtering a path of electric light through the silken puffs of clouds,

For as long as the moon has shimmered amidst a pool of darkness; emitting a stream of mystical silver rays,

For as long as the river has cascaded down the mountain slopes; culminating into a fountain of mesmerizing froth; after blending with the sparkling rocks,

For as long as the deserts have formed whirlpools of sand; with turbulent currents of dust sweeping majestically across every unleashing minute,

For as long as the rose has emanated its enchanting redolence; left its lingering fragrance to wholesomely besiege ones dreary persona,

For as long as raw salt has lived in the sea; rising and falling rampantly with the undulating waves,

For as long as the birds have chirped melodiously on the trees; inundating the nonchalant atmosphere with waves of enthralling music,

For as long as the potbellied turtle has philandered innocuously; nibbling merrily at the fat chunk of green leaves,

For as long as the stars have twinkled in the cloudless sky; granting celestial reprieve from the ominous dark circumventing the earth,

For as long as blistering lava has remained incarcerated in earth's belly; traveling at lightening speeds through a labyrinth of its crevices,

For as long as the chameleon has changed its shades; camouflaged itself perfectly with its vibrant surroundings,

For as long as the rain has plummeted from the sky; drenching scorched slabs of soil with stupendously cool water,

For as long as peacock has danced animatedly; opening its full plumage with violent outbursts of wind in the monsoons,

For as long as the iridescent rainbow has appeared in the sky; presenting a festoon of colors for one to sight,

For as long as the echo has reverberated in the deep valley; permeating bit by bit

into its everlasting darkness,

For as long as the virtue of attraction has existed between mammalians; drawing them closer into an intimate embrace, bestowing upon them the power to procreate,

For as long as there has been irrefutable truth; the essence of it hovering alive directions unprecedented,

For as long as the omnipresent aura of love encapsulates us all; bonding us perpetually with the threads of humanity,

And for as long as there has been the first leaf; the first droplet of liquid; the first living being on this earth; there has existed the person whom I am grateful for creating me; the one whom I today know as my first ancestor; my omniscient Creator.

12. ULTIMATE MASTER

Nobody understood the incomprehensible agony in my mind; the volcanic fountain of disdainful thoughts it was encapsulated with every unveiling minute,

Nobody understood the inexplicable misery blended with my blood; traversing faster than the speed of white light as I tread on the surface of this colossal earth,

Nobody understood the wretched dreams I had even while wandering under brilliant sunshine; the insurmountable fatigue experienced by my conglomerate of frigid nerves,

Nobody understood the insane madness which destroyed my every fantasy which was stupendously beautiful; converted my blissful existence into inconspicuous bits of threadbare ash,

Nobody understood the thunderous growling of my stomach; inspite of it being inundated till the brim with a battalion of salubriously appetizing food,

Nobody understood the irascible pounding on my heart; the tumultuous fury permeating it belligerently from all sides,

Nobody understood the unsurpassable repertoire of effusive desire welling up prolifically in my soul; the uncanny wavering it underwent every unfurling moment of the day,

Nobody understood the horrendously wavering apathy in my voice; the fire balls of blood enigmatically encompassing my eyes,

Nobody understood the frantic bouts of desperation I experienced in a single night; the deplorable gloom which surfaced cyclonically on my tongue; just as I opened

my mouth to talk,

Nobody understood the cowardice in my foot steps; the incredulously augmented fear in my stride; although I trespassed directly beneath the storm and completely

bare-chested,

Nobody understood the relentless string of dilemma's I was confronted with; the overwhelming myriad of infinite questions my mind asked me inevitably each

moment,

Nobody understood the blood curling screams that punctured through the slim walls of my intricate eardrum; rendering me deaf even in the midst of themost deafening commotion and boisterously blaring traffic,

Nobody understood the fathomless island of needles fulminating in my brain; the piquantly sizzling potpourri of lunatic ideas that devastated me in sheer helplessness; standing like an infant on cold ground,

Nobody understood the unrelenting tyranny with which my body was whipped in freezing air; the invisible barricades of thorns; that kept cropping as I alighted my each step,

Nobody understood the cloudburst of crimson blood that poured on my countenance in turbulent spurts; the acrimoniously pugnacious battlefield of emotions that kept dreaming my last ounce of vital strength,

Nobody understood the mystical emptiness that engulfed my diminutive body; the satanically gleaming swords which kept ripping through my throat as time gradually

unveiled,

Nobody understood the gruesome blackness which capsized me even at the onset of sweltering afternoon; the ocean of perspiration which indefatigably kept dribbling down my persona without the slightest of control or holistic respite,

Nobody understood the unprecedented bleariness that entrenched my vision; the alarmingly hopeless light that awaited me with hands fully outstretched; even as

the world outside walked at regular pace,

But there was indeed a person who understood me above all else in this Universe; and although I didn't possess the power to witness his Omniscient grace; Nevertheless I still considered him my best friend; an entity to whom I would always bow down in timid submission; a sacrosanct idol I would always keep praying to; as my "Ultimate Master"; my "Supreme Creator" .

13. OMNIPOTENT ALMIGHTY

He didn't need overwhelmingly lengthy articles written about him; to proclaim his glory sanctimoniously all around the globe,

He didn't need an armory of praise from a spurious bunch of individuals; to escalate his persona to the pinnacle of supremacy,

He didn't need television interviews to depict his supernatural powers; the miracles he could perform within lightening fractions of seconds,

He didn't need a cavalcade of cars following him; ploughing their way unceremoniously through innocent pedestrians to declare his raw power,

He didn't need an ocean of flowers everyday at his doorstep; to enlighten his spirits and drown him into a cocoon of enchantment,

He didn't need a battalion of bodyguards guarding his visage; armed gunmen trying to sequester him from all the evil in this world,

He didn't need an ambience of voluptuous clouds to relax in; mesmerizing fairies dancing around him and kissing his feet,

He didn't need a flurry of photographers clicking him umpteenth times in a single minute; trying to salvage the best of his face in different shades of light,

He didn't need jug fulls of water and mystical wine to be served every hour; the most sumptuous cuisine to be brought before him to eat sizzling fresh from the frying pan,

He didn't need groups of mavericks inexorably shouting slogans to propagate him; defending religion at the cost of infinite lives,

He didn't need a letter of introduction every time he tread on this earth; professionals in the media savvy world to announce every move he was about to make,

He didn't need a new and embellished space craft every morning; to transport him to the most fascinating places in this Universe; have ravishing cocktails with

every Nation's Prime Minister,

He didn't need a Mountain replete with bombastic gold and silver; dungeons impregnated with fathomless bundles of currency showered upon him incessantly

as the clock ticked,

He didn't need a wardrobe inundated with garish clothes; golden cufflinks and chains to adorn his body at the crack of every dawn,

He didn't need a cruise ride of the Atlantic every night; with stars shimmering in the cosmos propelling him fantasize to the most unprecedented limits and dream,

He didn't need traditionally attired attendants hovering indefatigably around his demeanor; fanning his face to ruthlessly massacre the last mosquito humming morbid tunes,

He didn't need slippers lined with resplendent silver to walk in the Bedroom; a bed studded with fabulous diamonds to nestle and blissfully sleep,

He didn't need a fleet of impeccable priests to engulf him and divulge to him his destiny to unveil; analyze his palms to intricately prognosticate the future life he

had to be lead,

And he didn't need any glamour and glitteratti; any pomp or gaiety to appease; any spurious propaganda to uplift his soul;

For a single word of his was enough to destroy; and at the same time create this entire planet; a single step of his was enough to give shape to what he had created; a single breath of his was enough to give life to his unfathomable creation; he was the most invincible form of a human being; HE was infact none other THAN OMNIPOTENT ALMIGHTY .

14. WHEN ALMIGHTY LORD SPOKE

When the garden of ravishingly crimson roses spoke; the acrimoniously miserly

thorn fell completely silent,

When the colossal dungeon replete with delectable honey spoke; the vial of heinous poison fell completely silent,

When the battalion of mesmerizing nightingales spoke; the hideously soaring wailing vultures fell completely silent,

When the overwhelmingly scintillating diamond spoke; the morbid pond incessantly buzzing with pertinent mosquitoes fell completely silent,

When the sparkling pair of astoundingly fresh vegetables spoke; the decayed bread with fungus coated all over; fell completely silent,

When the gargantuan mountain towering towards the naked patches of sky spoke; the lecherously hidden hole in the ground fell completely silent,

When the boundlessly swirling ocean waters spoke; the horrendously scorching granules of the acrid desert fell completely silent,

When the majestically striped tiger thunderously spoke; the fleet of menacing scorpions and lethal reptiles fell completely silent,

When the incomprehensibly huge fortified ship spoke; the deplorably broken boat sinking inevitably towards the bottom fell completely silent,

When infinite pages profusely blended with literature spoke; the wholesomely abashing fingerprint embodied on the wall fell completely silent,

When the magnificently embellished aircraft zipping into space spoke; the pretentiously dying and lazily crawling worm fell completely silent,

When the well inundated with frosty and sacrosanct cow milk spoke; the glass of profoundly diseased water fell completely silent,

When the insurmountably fragrant leaves of pure saffron spoke; the most ghastliest of stench emanating in the atmosphere fell completely silent,

When the brilliantly flamboyant Sun spoke; the sulking camouflage of appalling darkness fell completely silent,

When the supremely silken conglomerate of royal pearls spoke; the diabolically corrugated skin of the cannibalistic crocodile fell completely silent,

When the blazing cup of ecstatically rejuvenating tea spoke; the snobbishly shivering cold fell completely silent,

When the ingeniously crafted articulate mater key spoke; the countless hurdles and doors blocked beyond the point of despair; fell completely silent,

When the tantalizing aroma of delicious food spoke; the abominable pangs of bizarre starvation fell completely silent,

And when the Omnipotent grace of Almighty Lord spoke; the satanically savage and brutal devil fell completely silent .

15. THE ULTIMATE SIR

We all must have called someone or the other spuriously as SIR during our lives; in our insatiable desire to reach the zenith of prosperity,  
But the ultimate SIR was the irrefutably marvelous Creator; on whose divine fingertips; danced the entire planet towards the path of unflinching righteousness .

We all must have called someone or the other lackadaisically as SIR during our lives; in our mission to shrug inexplicable poverty and be the stupendous best,

But the ultimate SIR was the irrefutably majestic Creator; who evolved every bit of mesmerizing beauty; wandering bountifully on this colossal Universe .

We all must have called someone or the other abhorrently as SIR during our lives; in our yearning to catapult to overwhelming stardom and glitterati,

But the ultimate SIR was the irrefutably perennial Creator; on whose sacrosanct decisions; revolved the inevitable chapters of celestial life and death .

We all must have called someone or the other malevolently as SIR during our lives; in our greed to holistically survive; extract the optimum from the corridors of the hideously manipulative society,

But the ultimate SIR was the irrefutably immortal Creator; on whose revered shoulders rested the weight of this entire planet; blended with love; compassion

and mystically blooming forest .

We all must have called someone or the other pompously as SIR during our lives; in our relentless struggle to grant the most opulently tantalizing food to our impoverished stomachs,

But the ultimate SIR was the irrefutably invincible Creator; who spawned countless civilizations deluged with brilliant sunlight; within the single wink of his eye .

We all must have called someone or the other sinfully as SIR during our lives; in our unrelenting conquest of attaining astronomical power and fame,

But the ultimate SIR was the irrefutably unconquerable Creator; who gave infinite organisms a chance to exist in symbiotic harmony; with every single of his supremely everlasting breath .

We all must have called someone or the other worthlessly as SIR during our lives; in our intransigently augmenting search for pleasure; seduction and alluring happiness,

But the ultimate SIR was the irrefutably Omnipotent Creator; melanged land with unsurpassably towering mountains as well as tantalizingly tangy sea bed soil .

We all must have called someone or the other viciously as SIR during our lives; in our endless march forward to metamorphose each of our wishes into an absolute reality,

But the ultimate SIR was the irrefutably Omniscient Creator; who created man as the most ingenious being on this enamoring planet; showered stringent thunderbolts of lightening from the sky when the earth headed towards devastating malice .

We all must have called someone or the other baselessly as SIR during our lives; in our never ending aspiration of stuffing our pockets with glittering gold coin,

But the ultimate SIR was the irrefutably impregnable Creator; who instilled the beats of heavenly love in every heart alive; merged every religion named his inconspicuous molecules; into the religion of impeccable humanity .

And we must have called someone or the other lecherously as SIR during our lives; in our irrevocable urge to sail above the abundantly sparkling skies,

But the ultimate SIR was the irrefutably Omnipresent Creator; who magnificently articulated the destinies of boundless alive; saw to it that the planet perpetually maintained its equilibrium of good and evil; with truth and mankind eventually and forever outnumbering the bad .

16. BY THE GRACE OF GOD

Live like an grandiloquent eagle; soaring handsomely through the vivaciously bubbling crimson clouds,

Live like the mountains basking in the glory of perennially shimmering sunlight; intrepidly confronting every obstacle without their head flinching the slightest,

Live like the rhapsodically tangy waves of the ocean; clashing with rejuvenated fervor every instant against the chain of enigmatically mesmerizing rocks,

Live like the impeccable pigeon; retiring for a blissful nights sleep in its delectable nest; under the magnificently resplendent blanket of glittering stars,

Live like the belligerent soldier whose heart was more molten than candle wax; but who preferred to decimate his head; rather than bowing it to anyone other than

his motherland,

Live like the marvelously glowing jewel; that radiated its light full blossom; even in the most satanically gory tunnel of treacherous darkness,

Live like the exuberantly enthralling cloud of dawn; perpetuating every thoroughly dwindling entity with a rejuvenated gusto; to propel tirelessly ahead in life,

Live like the bountifully sprawling fruits of Nature's creation; proliferating millions of its kind as the hour unveiled to fill the day,

Live like the road that never ends; indefatigably weaving its path towards an island of overwhelming mysticism and astounding enchantment,

Live like the butterfly which stays perpetually ebullient; frolicking into a festoon of smiles even while incarcerated infinite feet beneath the earth,

Live like the Mother who knows nothing but sacrifice; enduring the severest agony conceivable on human planet; to spawn the most wonderful creation of Almighty Lord,

Live like the fire whose flames never die; triggering insurmountable infernos of untamed passion; even as torrential cloudbursts of rain ferociously pelted down,

Live like the leaves that never withered; clinging resiliently to the body of their master; even as the most heinous of devil tried to ruthlessly massacre them with his foot,

Live like the rose which immortally diffused its divinely scent; no matter how hard the acrimonious thorns tried to gobble it in their acerbic swirl,

Live like the irrefutably powerful lion of the jungle; reigning supremely over your priceless conscience for centuries unprecedented,

Live like the immaculately beautiful princess; spreading the most wonderful word of God; from deep within your heart to even the most remotely obsolete corner of this Universe,

Live like the soul which impregnated a wave of ingratiating vitality; in every organism who had reached the premature brink of hopeless extinction,

Live like the blessed couple of true lovers; being wholesomely oblivious to the manipulatively monotonous realms of the spuriously surviving society,

And most importantly live life to the most unfathomable limits; rejoicing and basking in Princely glory till perhaps beyond what your breath could perceive; but always do remember and chant this till the time you die; that live life by the grace of God .

17. MY BEST FRIEND- THE LORD ALMIGHTY.

My mother could never ever become my friend; too busy in her household chores and pursuing the passions of her life; always looking upon me as her newborn child; even though I catapulted to the greatest of heights,

My father could never ever become my friend; able to view nothing else but the colossal edifices of the robotic corporate empire before his eyes all night and day; with an occasional pat here and there on my head; too busy earning for the inevitable needs of the gargantuan family,

My sister could never ever become my friend; profoundly engaged in her own family and the crankiness of impetuous youth; with most of our conversations eventually resulting into the most thunderously demented of squabbles,

My grandfather could never ever become my friend; staunchly following his age old rigidly tyrannical ideologies; which I thoroughly detested and severely shirked to follow,

My grandmother could never ever become my friend; being the ultimate apostle

of orthodoxy and implementing only what the scriptures said; whilst I was one who solely listened to my passionate heart's commands,

My brother could never ever become my friend; as pangs of inconsolable jealously radiated in gay abundance from our persona's; in order to become the favorite child of our revered parents,

My wife could never ever become my friend; as we virtually digressed in every opinion; being the indefatigably scowling and blasphemously blaming north pole and south pole; contained in a single house,

My children could never ever become my friend; as they were just irascible infants; whose unendingly hysterical shrieks made me plead an unfathomable times on my knees; let alone whisper the word sanctity,

My uncle's and aunts could never ever become my friend; as they were profusely party circuit; those same very sanctimonious shows of meaningless drudgery; that I spat upon even in the wildest of my dreams,

My neighbors could never ever become my friend; as they lead life like a frigidly dysfunctional robotic clock; whilst every instant of my impoverished life; was enshrouded with unabashed sensuousness and spontaneity,

My colleagues could never ever become my friend; timelessly plotting schemes

to bury me alive in my corpse; in their parasitically unceasing quest of escalating to the pinnacle of blood soaked success,

My surroundings could never ever become my friend; as they too in their salaciously inebriated and adulterated state; stabbed me a zillion times to adopt the path of untruthful commercialism; whilst I eternally wanted to mélange each beat of my heart with the rudiments of nature divine,

My countrymen could never ever become my friend; as nearly each one of them

endlessly ran after the currency coin; time and again at the cost of the soil which they inhabited; whilst I perpetually considered the beats of love to be above every dimension and money on this blessed planet,

My teachers could never ever become my friend; because there was always this

stringent definition of respectability that came in between; our openheartedly divulging the innermost secrets of our hearts,

My profession could never ever become my friend; as I couldn't play even the

most infinitesimal of games with it; had to bow down before it like the ultimate power before granting it that unassailably meticulous touch; so that the world accepted it and I symbiotically survived,

My great ancestors and far off siblings/kin could never ever become my friend; as I hardly knew anything of them other than their names; and it wasn't my habit to entrust unshakable blind faith; into the most unchartered of territories,

My servants could never ever become my friend; as I never considered them as

servants in the first place; whilst they unstoppably reminded me of the same ghastly discrimination of this barbaric society; by licking dirt right in front of my eyes although I severely reprimanded them,

My very own breath could never ever become my friend; as I had the most insane of panic attacks with each inhalation of mine; overtly skeptical and unsure of whether another of its kind would find way into my nostrils or not,

Yet. I wasn't ever desperate and alone. Yet I wasn't ever devastated and betrayed. Yet I wasn't ever paralyzed and depressed. As I forever had the hands of my best friend: "The Lord Almighty" to soothe my brow; to uninterruptedly and unabashedly talk to; in my times of duress and exultation; in my times of life and death; who made me feel closer and closer to my mission of ameliorating all sick and deprived humanity;

who made me feel the most unconquerably priceless organism alive .

18. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO EMULATE THE CREATOR

To emulate a bird was very easy; as all you had to do was spread your arms wide; pretend to flap them in mighty draughts of air; standing on the pinnacle of the gorgeous valley,

To emulate a lion was very easy; as all you had to do was open your mouth wide; run in the midst of the densely foliated jungle; emanating thunderously roaring sounds,

To emulate an ant was very easy; as all you had to do was crawl painstakingly on the floor; miserably edge towards the loaf of freshly baked bread kept delectably on the kitchen table,

To emulate the horse was very easy; as all you had to do was vibrantly gallop in the sprawling fields of paddy; making a pathetically neighing noise every once a minute,

To emulate a snake was very easy; as all you had to do was adorn yourself in gruesomely black leather; slither enigmatically on the floor as the mystical rays of moonlight; illuminated the pool of darkness,

To emulate a dog was very easy; as all you had to do was diffuse a hoarsely barking sound; wag your posterior in ecstatic jubilation at witnessing your loved ones,

To emulate a pig was very easy; as all you had to do was greedily gobble mammoth chunks of food; wildly slurp any liquid or juice lying haphazardly spilled before you,

To emulate a Kangaroo was very easy; as all you had to do was bounce ebulliently in space with supremely spongy springs attached to your feet; gleefully leap to places you wanted to frequent; instead of traversing by naked foot,

To emulate a scorpion was very easy; as all you had to do paint lethal venom on your nails; point them diabolically at unsuspecting strangers that confronted you in your way,

To emulate the fish was very easy; as all you had to do was swim euphorically under the sea; nimbly swishing your hands and legs; with a cylinder of fresh oxygen strapped adroitly to both your slender shoulders,

To emulate a cockroach was very easy; as all you had to do was remain unwashed for boundless weeks; keep incessantly loitering around the public lavatory; inhaling the scent that wafted with stupendous relish,

To emulate a chimpanzee was very easy; as all you had to do was to scream hysterically each time you were struck by an urge to whisper; jump acrobatically from

one branch of the tree to the other; in search of fleshy fruits,

To emulate an elephant was very easy; as all you had to do was inflate your persona like a colossal gas balloon; tread triumphantly on the soil of the jungle as the largest organism existing in the rampant outgrowths,

To emulate the mosquito was very easy; as all you had to do was infuriatingly buzz in everyone's ear you met; exasperate people beyond the point of frustration with your monotonously boring tunes,

To emulate the grass hopper was very easy; as all you had to do was embellish your entire island of skin with emerald green; camouflage your visage brilliantly within the lanky stalks of grass on the hills; sleep in stark open with a festoon of iridescent stars

shining; clinging to the leaf,

To emulate the Bat was very easy; as all you had to do was adorn yourself in a hideous cloak of ominous black; stick astoundingly close to the mortuary wall

with repugnant fire blazing in your eyes; a menacing desire to kill lingering furtively in your heart,

To emulate the donkey was very easy; as all you had to do was stand erect in the middle of the crowded street with your shaven scalp; outrageously kick your heels

at anyone who ventured to come even frugal inches by your side,

To emulate the cat was very easy; as all you had to do was cunningly manipulate your every move; greedily guzzle the bottle of pure milk which the mother had kept stored for her new born infant,

but it was simply impossible to emulate the Almighty Creator; as first and foremost you would have to evolve all of the abovementioned; instill signs of palpable life on this incomprehensibly vast planet; when infact you didn't even know the slightest to

create your very own being?

19. UNCONQUERABLY AND SOLELY THE OMNISCIENT LORD !

For your most rustically bohemian accent; which cacophonically inundated every conceivable speck of the atmosphere with; disdainfully stinging melancholy,

For your most hoarsely impoverished state; when all that indefatigably rattled in your pockets was nothing but lackadaisically sacrilegious stone; with the planet not paying you a single penny for even the most ecstatically brilliant of your artistry,

For your most eccentrically reclusive habits; those countless baths and sensuality that you bizarrely indulged after the heart of perilous midnight; and then slept like a wastrel hog all blazingly optimistic day,

For your most painstaking bouts of nothingness; when you did nothing else but inexplicably stare at fathomless bits of open sky; till times immemorial,

For your most devastatingly impudent of tempers; wherein you simply hurled everything around you in vicinity into the realms of disdainful oblivion; stamping your foot as violently as untamed lightening in the sky,

For your most distinctively different ideologies from the entire planet; which irrefutably and tirelessly proclaimed that the greatest religion on earth was the religion of humanity; which granted egalitarian importance to the unnecessary killing of an

inconspicuous ant and man; alike,

For your most excruciating principles; wherein you were prepared to sacrifice your life this very instant; rather than digress even an infinitesimal iota from

whatever you'd diligently promised,

For your most precariously tottering pathways of righteousness; which 10 times out of 10 found themselves buried an infinite feet beneath threadbare mud; haplessly unable to thrive in today's world of prejudiced deceit and abhorrent malice,

For your most resolutely interminable beliefs; that there was nothing such as destiny in shaping an organism's life; as philanthropic hard work was all that escalated you to the absolute pinnacles of infallible success,

For your most uninhibitedly open beliefs; which wholeheartedly advocated that more sparkling invincible than sanctimoniously conventional marriage; was the compassionately humanitarian relationship of symbiotic friendship,

For your most stinkingly unclothed body; whose each deplorably unwashed ingredient was miserably enveloped; with an infinite layers and tons of acrimoniously squelching grime,

For your most worthlessly unabashed habit of forgetfulness; wherein at times you forgot your very own name; so obsessively engrossed in the inscrutably tantalizing mists of fantasy,

For your most unbearably informal eating habits; wherein you demonically gobbled the entire meal of the day in just one go; preferring to remain horribly emaciated the rest of the day,

For your most foolishly intrepid patriotism; as you entered the boundless battlefield of salaciously jeopardizing manipulation; diminutively naked against countless diabolical perpetrators of violently cold-blooded hatred and lies,

For your most egregiously stabbing candor; wherein the absolute truth that you always chose to fearlessly utter; could very well give the first and last heart-attack; to just about anyone whose parasitic guilt was exposed,

For your most unflinching belief in the law of fecund proliferation; wherein you procreated limitless more like your very own on planet divine; without even a

sordid penny in your pocket; and with the unstoppable laughter of the entire

planet to heartlessly bear,

For your most incessantly unshakable proclamation to the planet; to selflessly serve every fraternity of despairing living kind in order to reach the Almighty Lord; rather than wasting innumerable hours and donations to polish and pray infront of his stone

idol,

For your most immutably priceless ideal; that the power of Immortal Love was the most inimitably Omnipotent power on earth; when virtually everyone else on the globe today felt; that the currency coin was the other name of God,

For your most fanatically dedicated days; wherein you refrained to budge even an inch from your dwelling; endlessly writing and majestically absorbed in the craft of perennial poetry; whereas the planet outside boisterously tick-tocked from 9 to 9 earning fathomless currency coin,

O! Yes; even if after all this; there was anyone who would still accept you for whatever you were in today's sleazily monstrous planet; then it wasn't your Father; Mother; Grandfather; Grandmother; Brother; Sister; Beloved; Wife or an infinite more relations of the likes; but it was forever; unconquerably and solely

the Omniscient Almighty Lord .

20. THE LORD WAS PERPETUALLY WATCHING YOU!

You might utter an infinite abuses on eternally spell-binding creation; in the most nonchalantly decaying of gutter pipe; where there dared not creep even the most parsimoniously uninterested of soul,

You might abominably execute an infinite dastardly lies; in the realms of meaninglessly menacing wilderness; where there dared not creep even the most

ethereally lackadaisical of soul,

You might indiscriminately massacre an infinite innocent scalps; in the invidiously asphyxiating blackness of solitary midnight; where there dared not creep even the most fecklessly cowardly of soul,

You might sadistically wail an infinite tunes of death; in the aisles of demonically terrorizing hell; where there dared not creep even the most transiently anomalous of soul,

You might parasitically suck an infinite droplets of new-born blood; in the ominously thwarted labyrinths of the ominously cold-blooded dungeons; where there dared not creep even the most fugitively mercurial of soul,

You might sacrilegiously manipulate an infinite lives like lifeless commodities; in a despicably dying mist of nothingness; where there dared not creep even the most parsimoniously invisible of soul,

You might intransigently ridicule an infinite maimed and blind children; in the deserts of hopelessly crucifying boredom; where there dared not creep even the most inconspicuously intangible of soul,

You might abhorrently bombard an infinite civilizations of newness; in the midst of

devastatingly pin-drop sleep and cadaverous silence; where there dared not creep even the most penuriously deteriorating of soul,

You might satanically poison an infinite elements of altruistic simplicity; in the worthlessly livid vacuum that profanely existed between heaven and hell; where

there dared not creep even the most incomprehensibly invisible of soul,

You might malevolently steal an infinite moments of happiness from the symbiotic; in the graveyards of fetidly exacerbated extinction; where there dared not creep even the most despairingly disappearing of soul,

You might torturously blind an infinite pristinely enchanting of eyes; in the hideously moonless blackness; where there dared not creep even the most

ephemerally obfuscated of soul,

You might emotionlessly famish an infinite organisms of quintessential water and food; in the coffins of ruthlessly asphyxiating depression; where there dared not creep even the most despondently obsolete of soul,

You might deliriously incarcerate an infinite winds of philanthropic goodness; in the maniacally murderous tunnels of debauchery; where there dared not creep even the most inaudibly impoverished of soul,

You might heartlessly sell an infinite mothers including your very own; to earn those extra despicably worthless wads of currency; in the intolerably ribald nakedness of dusk; where there dared not creep even the most diminutively insipid of soul,

You might venomously besmirch an infinite brilliantly unfettered spirits of triumph; in the criminally uninhabited lanes of cannibalistic hatred; where there dared not creep even the most unrecognizably fluttering of soul,

You might unforgivably traumatize and hunt an infinite forests and priceless wildlife; in the indistinguishably ghoulish cry of the jinxed owl; where there dared not creep even the most indecipherably measly of soul,

You might barbarously close an infinite holistically impregnable breaths; in the gallows of cold-bloodedly excoriating prison; where there dared not creep even

the most non-existently meaningless of soul,

You might lethally perpetuate the poison of betrayal in an infinite immortally passionate hearts; in the mortuaries of the deplorable devil; where there dared

not creep even the most conceivably impoverished of soul,

And do whatever you wanted to; do wherever you wanted to; do whenever you wanted to; but remember O! disastrously greedy man; that if not anybody on this

fathomlessly inscrutable Universe; but the Omnipotent Lord Almighty was perpetually watching you and simultaneously ever other organism like you !

21. MAN AND GOD

Man pathetically stumbled on every step that he tread; taking Herculean loads of time to find his footing amidst the perilously slippery landscapes,

God unassailably controlled even the most infinitesimal movement of every entity; tangible or intangible on the trajectory of this fathomless earth; majestically and all the time .

Man profoundly concentrated only at one thing at a time; sporadically fantasizing every now again; into an entrenchment of insatiable wilderness,

God unshakably controlled even the most mercurial thought that diffused from the minds of every organism; on the canvas of this bountifully resplendent Universe .

Man committed an unsurpassable ocean of fallacies in his lifetime; inevitably erring when the winds of difficulty crept in an iota too harshly for the nimbly ingratiating body,

God irrefutably controlled even the most parsimonious traces of destiny of every organism; being the overwhelmingly impeccable entrenchment of righteousness in its soul .

Man ludicrously wilted as the horrifically ghastly impediments in his way; intensified their pressure an infinitesimal trifle,

God regally controlled even the most inconspicuous trace of strength of every organism; philanthropically endowing it with an insurmountable tenacity to massacre all evil with the sword of eternally scintillating humanity .

Man unwittingly wilted under the truculent pressure of the savagely acrimonious society; clambering the ladder of blatantly gory lies right since the very first cry of life,

God Omnisciently controlled even the most diminutive cry of every organism; metamorphosing its salaciously abusive demeanor into a fathomless paradise of

patriotic truth .

Man disastrously failed at umpteenth occasions of mystical life; spending many an indefatigable night in the dungeons of disparagingly inexplicable gloom,

God Omnipotently controlled even the most insipid longing of every organism; blazingly deluging its existence with an unending fireball of gloriously exhilarating optimism .

Man wholesomely shut his eyes at the downfall of midnight; sequestering himself in the impregnable delights of his abode to thoroughly wade off the onslaught of the mercilessly wandering devil,

God resplendently controlled even the most ethereal dreams of every organism; ingratiatingly embellishing its soul and conscience with a garland of perpetually

ubiquitous togetherness .

Man hopelessly sweated under the tyrannically treacherous rays of the Sun; disdainfully gasping for rejuvenating air in a civilization enshrouded with insidiously ghastly pollution,

God Omnipresently controlled even the most ephemeral breaths of every organism; bestowing it with a splendidly synergistic resilience; to lead a fathomless more lifetimes .

And man incessantly kept aimlessly strolling between the lanes of companionship and malicious betrayal; vacillating like an extinguishing matchstick to the whiplashes of unforgiving destiny,

While God immortally controlled even the most evanescent beat of every organism; flooding its survival with the waterfall of love; love and nothing else but everlastingly enchanting love .

22. INFRONT OF THE OMNIPRESENT ALMIGHTY LORD.

Even the most stinkingly rich; royally sleeping all day and sensuous night; on an unsurpassable ocean of sumptuously glistening gold and silver,

Even the most invincibly untamed; decimating countless civilizations of the innocent at a singleton stroke of their finger; as they detonated their nuclear firepower,

Even the most unassailably brilliant; able to perceive and paint even the most infinitesimal iota of this fathomless Universe; in a minuscule cranny of their endowed brains,

Even the most unflinchingly fearless; treading rampantly unabashed and wholesomely naked; through the most truculently asphyxiating devils and maelstroms,

Even the most obsessively perfectionist; who not only triumphantly accomplished the most acrimoniously monumental tasks in their lifetime; but made them a quintessential ingredient of their breath,

Even the most perennially white-skinned; who put the even the most obfuscated shades of black to bawdy shame; as they alighted only a single toe; at the most

unceremoniously unearthly hour of midnight,

Even the most enigmatically tantalizing; reinvigorating cisterns of redolently victorious life in the most deadened of carcasses; with their inimitably spell binding and inexhaustible cosmos of virility,

Even the most ardently artistic; metamorphosing even the most insouciantly feckless bits of mud; into an astounding labyrinth of timelessly ameliorating forms and shapes,

Even the most amazingly athletic; who could mold even the most inconspicuous bone of their body to any given situation; whether it be passing through an invisible

drainpipe; or whether it be walking on a thread which was an infinite feet above soil; and that too with grease on their barefoot,

Even the most brilliantly robotic; who deciphered through the most abstrusely contemporary of technology and puzzles; like merrily crunching almonds for morning breakfast,

Even the most fantastically eccentric; euphorically expending every unfurling instant of their life; to their very own desires and wishes; fathomless kilometers away from the fabric of the conventionally mechanized society,

Even the most rhapsodically effervescent; bustling into the full fervor of existence; indefatigably trying to touch the highest epitome of the clouds; every unfurling minute of bountiful life,

Even the most perpetually patriotic; altruistically ready to behead the very last bone of their skull; for deliberating even an ounce of their deceitfully incarcerated motherland,

Even the most unceasingly philanthropic; majestically entwining their fingers with every echelon of horrendously deprived mankind; insuperably ensuring the mantra of "Live and Let Live" in every direction that they tread,

Even the most unconquerably magical; evolving an unlimited entrenchment of vibrantly unshakable life; out of inanely decrepit nothingness,

Even the most blazing World Leaders; tirelessly extemporizing the complexion of this drearily strangulated planet; dexterously controlling its reigns on their slender fingertips,

Even the most victorious healers; magically transforming even the most deadliest of disease; pain and debilitation; into a paradise of compassionately emancipating freshness; with their limitless cornucopia of medicines and balms,

Even the most inexhaustibly friendly; who couldn't walk a step further on the trajectory of blessed earth; without synergistically amalgamating with infinite more of their living kind; irrespective of caste; creed; color or spurious tribe,

Even the most mellifluously vivacious; eternally transforming even the most morbidly deadened arenas of the atmosphere; into a heaven of spell bindingly enamoring togetherness,

Were all the most sinfully castrated of beggars; were all the most inconspicuously non-existent of mosquitoes; were all the most unsolicitedly swarming pieces of shit; were all the most pulverized bits of obsolescence; were all the most tawdrily disappearing of parasites; were all the most emotionlessly crumbling of fools; were all the most raucously wailing strands of the corpse; were all the most insensitive ingredients of meaninglessness; infront of the Omnipresent Almighty Lord.

24. BEYOND MAN

Beyond morbid exteriors of vulture egg; lie immaculate pearls in the shell of oyster,

Beyond frigid feathers of peacock; lie steel wings of the fighter jet,

Beyond soiled persona of bathroom slippers; lies a compactly juxtaposed shoe,

Beyond scantily fortified blades of table fan; lies the colossal silhouette of wind mill,

Beyond threadbare moulds of lackluster tin; lies ostentatious biscuits of gold,

Beyond the surreal demeanor of black ant; lies the invincible dinosaur,

Beyond dilapidated realms of broken hut; lies the articulately synchronized palace,

Beyond despicable light of the sodium bulb; lies the dazzling brilliance of sun,

Beyond scarce trickle of crystal mountain stream; lies the magnanimous ocean,

Beyond mundane display of the century old type-pad; lies the hi-tech computer,

Beyond cloistered interiors of diminutive timepiece; lies the gargantuan clock tower,

Beyond revered portrayal in exquisite sculpture; lies the true stalwart,

Beyond extravagant dreams of suffering; lies the real pain,

Beyond variegated leaves of Christmas tree; lie sprawling meadows of untamed green,

Beyond the monotony of onerous work; lies impeccable truth imbibed in soul,

Beyond fledglings of tender fur; lies the menacing panther,

Beyond petite footsteps while treading on silk; lie violent kicks dismantling ground,

Beyond pilfering minute quantities of currency note; lies the cold blooded serial killer,

Beyond garrulous talk of shrewd businessman; lies the innocuous cry of a baby,

Beyond frugal droplets of languid rain; lies tumultuous avalanches of snow cascading down,

Beyond the jelly fish fluttering in a shallow tank; lies Grey whale inhaling

exorbitantly in the ocean,

Beyond a volley of disdainful abuse hurtling rampantly from mouth; lies sacrosanct preaching,

Beyond parables of venomous hatred; lies compassionate anecdotes of love,

Beyond frivolous dispositions towards alien; lies the life bestowing mother,

And beyond sheer intelligentsia; contemporary inventions of man; lies the omnipotent Creator.

25. HOW WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO WELCOME GOD ON DIWALI ?

With the footprints of brotherhood that you left when you embraced one and all-OR With venomous bellows of nonchalant smoke which diabolically tarnished his pristine atmosphere?

With the song of peace that you hummed from the innermost realms of our heart-OR With inexplicable misery that you inflicted upon boundless with the hideous noise of bombs exploding on every nook; corner and street?

With the magical wand of your friendship which transcended over every caste; creed; religion and tribe-OR With hurling cacophonic rockets at each other with the angst to kill ostensibly radiating from your bloodshot eyes?

With the ardor in your breath to exist in a perfect symbiosis with your fellow human being and the environment-OR With umpteen number of your sleazy bedlam bulbs that you stuck to innocent trees to torture their body-on spurious pretext of illuminating the air around?

With a fresh dawn of creativity in your veins to evolve tomorrows of new-found hope-OR With garishly parasitic rolling fire-balls which caused many a car and innocuous life to explode in flames; as it unwittingly trespassed their way?

With a noble spirit to part with your wealth for the assistance of all those rendered roofless- OR With spitting incoherent abuses on his priceless environment as your sinister looking cracker floundered to burst?

1.

HOW WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO WELCOME GOD ON DIWALI?

With the feeling of being just a piece of nothing infront of his Omnipresent aura- OR With mercilessly beheading trees left; right and center; in order to pave a clear way to welcome spurious dignitaries who wanted bangs and smoke?

With the sacred vow of eternal companionship you took for every of his created living beings-OR With simmering vindication in your soul as you torched the virgin sands of time with worthless sparklers swaying insidiously in your palms?

With due obeisance in your eyes for his unshakably Omnipotent fragrance-OR With innumerable holes that you'd dug in the belly of his earth; just in order to erect your shops selling bombs and explosives of the most denigrating degree?

With the oneness of his creation proudly sparkling from every inch of your persona-OR With every of your valiant bone sadistically succumbing to the commands of the devil-who simply couldn't wait for you to ignite his amorphously deafening bomb?

With resolving to make the mantra of 'live and let live' the rhythm of your life-OR With playing the filthiest of politics to burn one sect of the society into flames; and become the sanctimonious unsung hero of others; to leapfrog towards your blood-stained throne?

With being a harbinger of peace to unite every bereaved soul into a valley of love-OR With indulging into vandalism of the highest order; as you banged explosive shells into breathing grass to release the inexplicable frustration of your fists?

2.

HOW WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO WELCOME GOD ON DIWALI?

With simple 'diyas (lamps)' of love; compassion; truth in your homes and all across your heart- OR With dousing the entire harmless street with petrol and then lighting the matchstick to witness it disintegrate into bits of worthless nothingness and flames?

With a scepter of righteousness in your chest and unflinching stride which shunted all lies- OR With a manipulatively farcical bunch of friends who laughed till death as they viewed millions of bombs produce a diabolical crackle in the heavenly night?

With a mission to conserve and nourish his unbridled environment with  
your very own breath and till your death- OR With shooing every helpless bird and animal on the streets as you struck them with misery after misery of demonic smoke and ear-shattering sound?

With a pledge to follow the Religion of Humanity; the only religion he guided you to follow; till the time you existed-OR With dead human bodies and corpses on your shoulders-which you hadn't deliberately killed; but were a victim of your riotously carefree fire-cracker splurge?

With kneeling down to his Omniscient holy spirit and asking for forgiveness for every of your erroneously human misdeed-OR With devastating every bit of his sacrosanct earth with rancid fire-only to show to the world the multiple varieties of bombs and explosives you'd spent on to make merry in the dead?

Well. Well. Well. I'll leave you to answer these questions on your own- as we've all been blessed with a conscience; heart; soul and spirit to immortally love; by the same God who is one for all of us.

And whilst you do so; All I'll do is pray to him; that you take the right decision this time and everytime; as we gear up to celebrate a very happy Diwali and prosperous New Year.

26. IF THIS HEAD WOULD EVER BOW DOWN

Not even an infinitesimal trifle infront of the greatest of Mountains; the most indomitably towering and unconquerably intrepid of their Herculean epitomes,

Not even a diminutive trifle infront of the greatest of Philosophers; the most sacredly learned and pricelessly inimitable of their sermons on the chapters of symbiotic existence,

Not even a mercurial trifle infront of the greatest of Forests; the most majestically untamed and insuperably parading of their indomitable lions,

Not even an evanescent trifle infront of the greatest of Warriors; the most

scintillatingly patronizing and fearlessly infallible of their impregnable swords,

Not even an ethereal trifle infront of the greatest of Oceans; the most fabulously triumphant and unflinchingly undulating of their glorious waves,

Not even an oblivious trifle infront of the greatest of Roses; the most sensuously inebriating and marvelously unbridled of their pristine scent,

Not even an abstemious trifle infront of the greatest of Seductresses; the most evocatively tantalizing and supremely glistening of their beautifully embellished bellies,

Not even a vespered trifle infront of the greatest of Magicians; the most fantastically resplendent and wonderfully emollient of their intriguing tricks,

Not even an infidel trifle infront of the greatest of Artists; the most poignantly heartfelt and gloriously uninhibited of their boundless creations,

Not even an inconspicuous trifle infront of the greatest of Moon; the most resplendently effervescent and exhilaratingly enlightening of its supernatural shine,

Not even a parsimonious trifle infront of the greatest of Curreny Coin; the most supremely accentuated and royally comforting of its indispensably brilliant glitter,

Not even an oblivious trifle infront of the greatest of Institution; the most splendidly fabulous and unsurpassably eclectic of its innovative teaching patterns,

Not even an obsolete trifle infront of the greatest of Politicians; the most

manipulatively uncanny and unsparingly pulverizing of their brutal ways,

Not even a disappearing trifle infront of the greatest of Castles; the most

gorgeously adorned and indefatigably unassailable of their ardently inimitable thrones,

Not even a vacillating trifle infront of the greatest of Destiny Lines; the most irrefutably unfurling and inevitably emollient of their enigmatic pathways,

Not even a feckless trifle infront of the greatest of Nightingales; the most unbelievably serendipitous and holistically purifying of astounding melodies,

most unrelentingly unstoppable and timelessly unimpeachable of their virgin winds,

But if ever this head had to bow down infront of anyone of this spell bindingly fathomless Universe; then it would be and forever be none other than; the invincibly sacred feet of my Mother who bore me in her divinely womb for 9 painstaking months and the grace of the perpetually Omnipotent Almighty Lord; who bestowed upon me breath to live and wholesomely created me.

27. MY FAITH IN GOD –WHEN I FELT I WAS DYING

With every majestic sunset making way for the Immaculate moon; that astoundingly depicted the multifarious shades of this Universe—which was a gift from the Omnipotent Creator,

With every draught of exuberant wind; that evolved into a whole new mist of rhapsodic excitement; out of sheer and insipid nothingness,

With every dainty petal of the poignant rose; that permeated a scent of oneness in the otherwise monotonously subjugated atmosphere,

With every vivacious stroke of the mesmerizing rainbow; that charmed the entire Universe; fraught with its own inexplicably unsolicited misery,

With every infinitesimal speck of the atmosphere; that invincibly clung to the bodies of us living beings; befriending an entire Universe of solidarity-from its own realms of isolation and despair,

With every step that marched forward to maintain the royal equilibrium of life; ensure that life went on despite anything and everything; but only by the grace of God,

With every flight of unbridled fantasy; that made even the most inconspicuously ordinary of living being; catapult beyond the definitions of desire,

With every squeak that escaped the throat; triumphantly piercing the bizarre sullenness and silence of the atmosphere with a desire to be embraced by one and all,

With every sensuously tantalizing night; that unfurled into the morning of a bountifully optimistic and brilliant dawn,

With every solemn pledge of goodwill in the graveyard; that bedazzled the ghastly silence of remorseful death; with a new found longing to disseminate love and life,

With every rumble of inscrutable thunder in the sky; that brought alongwith it the optimistic promise of rain; an infallible reason to cheer in the aisles of ecstasy,

With every inimitably righteous footprint left on soil; that carved an entire pathway of unflinching goodness; love and peace; as the quintessential elements to lead life with,

With every idea that uninhibitedly germinated from the brain; blossoming into boundless sparks of freshness; to unite the entire planet into the religion of love,

With every affable outgrowth that joyously leapt out of soil; instantaneously engulfed with the blessed rays of the Sun; after an equally compassionate cuddling by mother soil,

With every handshake executed between people of all race; religion and color; paving way for the most immortal and unassailable religion of humanity,

With every lump of frigidly asphyxiating snow; that perseveringly labored its way to becoming the most adorable stream of love; as its eventual outcome,

With every step traversing on the road not taken; permeating robotic chunks of the atmosphere with tantalizing splashes of adventure,

With every anecdote of failure that strengthened one's resolve to succeed all the more; metamorphosing every bit of morbid ash into an opportunity to holistically survive,

My faith in God grew; as irrespective of whatever has happened or would happen from now on; I know it would be for the good—

As God is my faith; God is my life- God gives me the power to symbiotically survive with one and all till the time he commanded-

And whenever he decides to take me away from this earth of his; I sincerely pray from my heart and soul to him; to be able to utter his name in poetry and song; when I felt I was dying.

28. YOU WERE NOTHING

Whether you were stinkingly rich; or whether you spent your entire lifetime begging discordantly on the bizarrely impoverished streets; for the Lord Almighty you and every other living being that he had created; was; is and shall forever be majestically equal,

But one thing was for unconquerably sure; that in front of his Omnipotently Supreme grace; you were nothing but a coffin of frigidly crumbling and egregiously disoriented matchsticks.

Whether you were indomitably overpowering; or whether you slithered like a maim dog to catch even the most strident parts of your shadow; for the Lord Almighty you and every other living being that he had created; was; is and shall forever be spell bindingly equal,

But one thing was for immutably sure; that in front of his Royally Unshakable empire; you were nothing but a dustbin orphaned with inconspicuously lackadaisical flies.

Whether you were innovatively brilliant; or whether you slept like a dumb tubelight even under the most flamboyantly exhilarating of Sun; for the Lord Almighty you and other every living being that he had created; was; is and shall forever be bountifully equal,

But one thing was for irrefutably sure; that in front of his Omnipresently iridescent paradise; you were nothing but a carcass of ethereally rotting bones.

Whether you were as white as a sensuously silken angel; or whether you chugged like hedonistically black charcoal even in the blackness of the wholesomely obfuscated night; for the Lord Almighty you and every other living being that he had created; was; is and shall forever be resplendently equal, But one thing was for unchallangably sure; that in front of his unassailably fathomless aura; you were nothing but a molecule in the mist of nothingness; that was never going to be born.

Whether you were taller than impregnably charismatic Everest peaks; or whether you shorter than the preposterously tiny ant's eggs; for the Lord Almighty you and every other living being that he had created; was; is and shall forever be inimitably equal,

But one thing was for irrevocably sure; that in front of his unshakably boundless form; you were nothing but a measly droplet of stray water; rapidly drying even before the day could unveil out.

Whether you were an everlasting apostle of blissfully symbiotic peace; or whether you stared in decrepit haplessness all your life towards abysmal sky; for the Lord Almighty you and every other living being that he had created; was; is and shall forever be regally equal,

But one thing was for invincibly sure; that in front of his Perpetually Omniscient fragrance; you were nothing but a trashcan of disillusioned invectives; disastrously trembling under your unsavory grave.

Whether you were like a stupendously boisterous bee; or whether you castrated each unraveling instant of your life in the corpses of treacherously remorseful loneliness; for the Lord Almighty you and every living being that he had created; was; is and shall forever be fantastically equal,

But one thing was for insuperably sure; that in front of his magnanimously bestowing

heart; you were nothing but a gutter of repugnantly untreated sewage; rotting like waif feces without the slightest integrity of your own.

Whether you conversed in the most aristocratically impregnable of English; or whether you dolorously stagnated in the dungeons of illiteracy with belligerent rats; for the Lord Almighty you and every living being that he had created; was; is and shall forever be celestially equal,

But one thing was for triumphantly sure; that in front of his unlimitedly divine form; you were nothing but a puff of nonchalant dust; disintegrating into a billion particles of meaninglessness with the tiniest draught of breeze.

Whether you were greatest leader of devout religious spirituality; or whether the womb that bore you 9 months was that of a wastrel prostitute; for the Lord Almighty you and every living being that he had created; was; is and shall forever be harmoniously equal,

But one thing was for unendingly sure; that infront of his Victoriously Ebullient Kingdom; you were nothing but a fecklessly diseased ghost; cadaverously wandering without the slightest of entity or coruscated form.

And whether you were the most immortally cherished lover; or whether you were horribly maimed and blinded since the very first cry of inscrutable life; for the Lord Almighty you and every living being that he had created; was; is and shall forever be beautifully equal,

But one thing was for irretrievably sure; that infront of his Glory of limitless righteousness and truth; you were nothing but a parsimoniously slavering lacunae of dirt; drowning more and more rapidly into the mortuary of hopelessly evaporating hell.

29. PRAYING FOR FORGIVENESS- TO GOD AND HIS HOLY MESSENGERS

My love for you; was my sole religion; transcending over every other discrepancy of caste; creed; color; tribe and humbly endeavoring to unite the entire planet with the best religion of them all; The Religion of Humanity,

My obeisance towards you; was my sole enrichment to live; imbibe the true fragrance of existence in perfect symbiosis with every speck of your fathomlessly wonderful environment,

My salutations towards you; were my sole honor to survive amidst a pack of wolves; be unwavering in my stride and mission of goodness; even as the cannibals of greed converged upon me from all ends,

My prayers imploring you; were my sole directions in this truncated lifetime; doing my destined job to my very best by your grace; and then leaving everything else upon your Omnipotent stride to decide,

My speaking your name; was my sole blessedly enlightened moment of life; making me oblivious to every diabolical dagger thrust towards me; and rising with infallible truth- with the first rays of sunrise,

My remembering your divine light; was my sole lantern of happiness amidst the bemoaning blackness that tightened its vice like grip; empowering me to tower above every color; and yet emerge victorious with the color of love,

My faith in you; was my sole pillar of strength; metamorphosing every diminutively trembling bone of mine to march on the path of righteousness; carving a history of love out of sheer and vapid nothingness,

My perception of you; was the sole end of my imagination; as you owned the entire Universe and beyond; and everything good in this life commenced and blissfully ended with the boundaries you gave me to live,

My embracing your living Mosque, Temple, Church, Monastery; was my sole moment of fulfillment that absolved me of even the most  inadvertently committed of my sins; and evolved a brand new path of vibrant life,

My asking your mercy; was the sole boon of my beleaguered twilight; as I could now exuberantly mélange shoulder to shoulder with the world outside; and only bow my head at your Omniscient feet,

My visualizing your sky; earth and the atmosphere that lay in between; was the sole poetry that radiated from my countenance; as my humane ability to cognize started and ended with whatever you limited me to see,

My following your Omnipresent light; was the sole path that I tread on in this devout survival; letting every uninhibited ounce of positive energy in my heart; to escape into sacrosanct wisps of the atmosphere,

My intensity to become one with your light; was the sole essence of everything humanitarian that I executed as the days unveiled; earnestly attempting my very best to unite all living kind; into an earth of love,

My belief in whatever you had destined was for the good; was the sole principle on which I placed the roots of my life; which again was the most wondrously mesmerizing gift to traverse upon earth; from your heavens,

My poems for you; were the sole reason that I always felt as if in compassionate paradise amongst the most usurping of humans; but your Omnipotent aura of love ruling my conscience over one and all,

My yearning to be in perpetual bewilderment of your majestic Universe; was my sole expression to flourish on planet divine; entwining my palms in unflinching unity with my fellow mates in duress,

My worshipping you from the innermost realms of my heart; was the sole ritual of holiness that I performed till I quit breath; loving you and your invincibly unparalleled ways in the best manner that you taught me to,

Therefore O! Lord Almighty and your holy messengers; I hereby pray to you to forgive me for even the most inadvertently committed of my misdeed;

And if you cannot pardon me; then give me death this very instant in whatever form you may choose to; But please don't be angry with me; Please don't stop loving me-for without your love; I'd be as good as ghastily dead; and yet with breath.

Every speck of my eye frantically wanted to sight it; insatiably yearning to witness its gloriously unfathomable and emphatically commiserating contours,

Every ingredient of my blood intransigently wanted to cherish it; relentlessly desiring to coalesce with its wonderfully resplendent essence of timelessly miraculous mankind,

Every pore of my skin desperately wanted to feel it; ebulliently unite with its rhapsodically bountiful swirl; till times beyond infinite infinity,

Every line of my palm incorrigibly wanted to drift with it; perpetually make it the ultimate elixir to lead life; perpetually make it the ultimate destiny to symbiotically exist for a countless more lifetimes,

Every globule of my sweat tirelessly wanted to flirt with it; tantalizingly philander with its marvelously enchanting spirit; every unfurling minute of the day; as well as through the winds of the charming night,

Every hair on my countenance irrefutably wanted to intermingle with it; replenish a whole new civilization of bountiful beauty; with each of its magically endowing and princely elements,

Every cringe on my forehead insatiably wanted to encapsulate it; beautifully feeling its harmoniously synergistic imagery; accepting it as the only and sole preaching to

lead vibrantly euphoric life,

Every undulation of my eyelashes uncompromisingly wanted to savor it; flutter every now and again for its impeccably holistic soul; for its timelessly proliferating township of boundlessly everlasting beauty,

Every iota of my conscience synergistically wanted to harness it; unflinchingly march forward towards the path it drifted; saluting its victoriously blazing spirit for centuries unprecedented,

immutable magic; and let those words "IT", be nothing else but immortal love in my penurious life.

32. THROUGH THEM.

Through them; even the most acridly blistering rays of the fiery midday Sun; seemed like angels of enchantingly whispering tranquility,

Through them; even the most morbidly remorseful sewage leaking sordidly from the gutters; seemed like waterfalls of epitomizing harmony; wonderfully coalescing with the fabric of eternal mankind,

Through them; even the most discordantly thundering of treacherous monsters; seemed like messiahs of blissfully celestial peace,

Through them; even the most abominably gruesome scents; seemed like a cloudburst of stupendously poignant fragrance; majestically diffusing a fountain of vivacious resplendence to every traumatically parched entity around,

Through them; even the most pathetically morose graveyards; seemed like fathomless skies of Omniscient beauty and benign grace; regally spawning into a civilization of newness every unfurling instant of the sweltering day,

Through them; even the most insanely lunatic madmen; seemed like harbingers of heavenly peace and humanity; disseminating an unfathomable entrenchment of

compassion on every step that they transgressed,

Through them; even the most sullenly decaying carcasses; seemed like philanthropically scintillating rays of the tenacious Sun; filtering a path of

astronomically aristocratic courage through corpses; of manipulative malice,

Through them; even the most invidiously bizarre thorns; seemed like hives of unsurpassably uniting honey; spell bindingly propagating a wave of unbelievable melody in the lives of all those horrendously deprived,

Through them; even the most acrimoniously twisted paths; seemed like fortresses of irrefutably ingratiating solidarity; sequestering one and all; irrespective of caste; creed and spurious color; beautifully alike,

Through them; even the most salaciously diabolical of demons; seemed like bloomingly mesmerizing gardens of spiritual charisma; ubiquitously parading towards the path of impregnable righteousness,

Through them; even the most forlornly dilapidated spaces; seemed like winds of ebulliently enthralling ecstasy; voluptuously titillating every beleaguered traveler who inadvertently came their way,

rebelliously frazzled mind,

God's most glorious creation; forever symbolizing the unshakable path

towards freedom and mankind.

33. THE SKY OF UNCONQUERABLE LOVE.

If you asked me how tall was it; I would perhaps miserably stutter; faltering an umpteenth number of times; before I could even emanate an inconspicuous

whisper,

If you asked me how vivacious was it; I would perhaps stumble like ninepins on obdurate ground; ludicrously bedazzled by that extra tinge of somberly radiant

light,

If you asked me how fragrant was it; I would perhaps have to frantically rummage through the records of a several thousand years; and yet eventually find myself

enshrouded by dungeons of inexplicably horrendous blackness,

If you asked me how boisterous was it; I would perhaps have to furiously contemplate for hours immemorial; laboriously delving into the most inscrutably esoteric realms of my beleaguered mind,

If you asked me how piquant was it; I would perhaps gasp for fresh air literally relinquishing the last breath of my life; maniacally ripping apart my hair for an answer; that simply wasn't to be,

If you asked me how charismatic was it; I would perhaps nonchalantly stare into disgusting space for countless more births of mine; worthlessly dithering towards a horizon that irrefutably didn't have any end,

If you asked me how conspicuous was it; I would perhaps grope wildly in an entrenchment of insane dreariness; wholesomely obfuscated for direction in

the island of diabolical hell,

If you asked me how harmonious was it; I would perhaps incoherently dither on the footsteps of utter devastation; lunatically running a marathon in the ungainly wild; that would never end,

If you asked me how formidable was it; I would perhaps commence to miserably slither on the ghastly ground; ghastily metamorphosing every dream of my blissfully

ravishing sleep; into a perpetually gory nightmare,

If you asked me how phlegmatic was it; I would perhaps excoriate all my hair apart in bizarre frustration; lambasting my scalp till eternity; in quest of the most sagacious of answer,

If you asked me how vivacious was it; I would perhaps pathetically stagger towards obsolete wisps of lackadaisical nothingness; eventually landing into the menacing gutters of horrific starvation,

If you asked me how immaculate was it; I would perhaps nervously flutter under the morbidly sullen carpet of the penalizing night; almost getting mercilessly straddled in the graves of tyrannical discomfort,

If you asked me how redolent was it; I would perhaps insipidly crumble into a dustbin of infinitesimal ash; preposterously disappearing into oblivion; in trying

to salvage for the most veritable of solutions,

If you asked me how fast was it; I would perhaps abhorrently drift my neck in boundless directions; in the end collapsing like a pack of soggy cards; to coalesce

with maliciously vindictive soil,

If you asked me how turbulent was it; I would perhaps gnaw even the last strand of my nails in utter nonchalance; stare like an imperturbable idiot into the hostile depths of the unending well,

If you asked me how melodious was it; I would perhaps blast every sanctimonious sound in my throat to juxtapose with meaningless infinity; lecherously sinking deeper and deeper into cold blooded earth,

If you asked me how rhetoric was it; I would perhaps lugubriously slip even on the most formidably handsome of grounds; profusely bleeding in exasperated confusion even in the most brilliantly bestowing of sunlight,

If you asked me how euphoric was it; I would perhaps unsteadily waver in absolutely despondent submission; trouncing every shade of overwhelming jubilation with

despicable doom,

But if you asked me to execute it; then I would unequivocally unite the entire planet in its stupendously compassionate threads of priceless humanity; for it was none other than the garland of spell binding creation; the sky of unconquerable love.

35. SOLE PLUS POINT

You bestowed upon him just the steering wheel; and the very next instant he lecherously demanded for the entire showroom of glittering grandiloquent cars; to

drive on a fresh wheel every new minute,

that he stood on the epitome to rule the whole planet,

You bestowed upon him just a tiny jewel; and the very next instant he barbarically demanded for the entire wealth of this earth; to eat; walk and sleep on a platter of unequivocal gold,

You bestowed upon him just a globule of water; and the very next instant he insidiously demanded for the entire ocean of boisterously tangy salt; to solely

sail on its handsomely undulating waves,

You bestowed upon him just a robust fruit; and the very next instant he ruthlessly demanded the entire forest of unfathomable delicacy; to placate even the wholesomely dead bowels of his impudent stomach,

You bestowed upon him just a solitary roof; and the very next instant he tyrannically demanded all the castles in this Universe; to harbor his unsurpassable plethora of heinous misdeeds,

You bestowed upon him just a stringent voice; and the very next instant he snobbishly demanded all the blissful melody on this planet; to indefatigably

appease even the most remotest of sordid wax; incarcerated in his bohemian eardrum,

You bestowed upon him just a beautiful dream; and the very next instant he invidiously demanded for the land of ravishingly bountiful paradise; profusely

titillating even the most infinitesimal chords; of his lackadaisically sensuous appetite,

You bestowed upon him just a stream of vital blood; and the very next instant he dreadfully demanded the scalp of every other living being; to immortalize his so called spurious of existence; to make him unequivocally; the strongest organism alive,

You bestowed upon him just a compassionate stone to sleep; and the very next instant he sordidly demanded all mesmerizing fur and scintillating satin in this

world to be at his feet; so that he could indiscriminately trample and play with it,

You bestowed upon him just an inconspicuous fragrance; and the very next instant he worthlessly demanded the fairies from the cosmos to descend down and

unrelentingly dance in front of him; so that he swayed in the aisles of voluptuous desire for centuries immemorial,

You bestowed upon him just a tumbler of rain from the sky; and the very next instant he diabolically demanded the entire entrenchment of rhapsodically vivacious clouds; so that he could evolve the destiny of countless; while majestically sailing in free space,

37. RULING OVER EVERY BEAT OF MY HEART.

It might be throbbing unrelentingly in pain; after witnessing the pathetically windling state of mother nature; the infinite invidious atrocities inflicted upon her belly; by salaciously robotic man,

It might be throbbing indefatigably in ecstasy; after witnessing the pristinely untamed roar of the ocean; as magical tangy froth swirled in unison; to the first cry of exuberant dawn,

It might be throbbing unabatedly in remorse; after witnessing the lifelessly decrepit skeleton of a human; brutally suspended in the center of the street; by insane powerhouses of corruption and wealth,

It might be throbbing untiringly in desire; after witnessing the sensuously vivacious woman step unclothed out of the waterfall; and into the inscrutable wilderness of the moonless night,

It might be throbbing unstoppably in contempt; after witnessing the indescribably humiliation still suffered by those infirm and deprived women; at the mercilessly marauding feet of the rich,

It might be throbbing uncontrollably in mystique; after witnessing the most diminutive of whisper rebound effortlessly from the highest apogees of the valley; before eventually culminating into an unconquerable echo,

It might be throbbing extraordinarily in vindication; after witnessing the completely idiosyncratic and barbaric discrimination meted upon even new born children; in the name of so-called spurious religion and

creed,

It might be throbbing intransigently in euphoria; after witnessing the evolution of the miraculously resplendent rainbow; from the core of absolute nothingness and unsparingly sweltering Sun in the afternoon sky,

It might be throbbing unflinchingly in belligerence; after witnessing countless innocuous trees being ruthlessly insulted and castrated; to

give way to disdainful corporate houses of emotionless concrete,

It might be throbbing fierily in excitement; after witnessing triumphantly virgin droplets of rain; unabashedly cascade and timelessly impregnate; fathomless kilometers of barren soil,

It might be throbbing uninterruptedly in grief; after witnessing the full fury of nature; as just a few milliseconds of the earthquake brought the mightiest of civilizations toppling down; formed mountain and ocean from the absolute graveyards of nowhere,

It might be throbbing unimaginably in victory; after witnessing just a single ray of truth; everlastingly towering over even the most boundless mortuaries of satanic manipulation and bawdy lies,

It might be throbbing unlimitedly in hopelessness; after witnessing the unattended cry of millions of orphaned children; which were enough

to shake the roots of any civilization; but yet miserably floundered to awaken the sanctimonious sleep of those grown up and enriched,

It might be throbbing fervently in enchantment; after witnessing the most bewildering twists; turns and trysts with destiny; the inexplicably spine-chilling adventures of the chapter called life,

It might be throbbing fearlessly in renaissance; after witnessing the oppressed being unsparingly mutilated even further; by cold-blooded politicians sinking their non-existent foundations deeper and deeper

into innocent blood,

It might be throbbing poignantly in selflessness; after witnessing that the richest and the poorest on this gigantic earth; blended in a few globules of parsimonious mud; after veritable death,

It might be throbbing undauntedly in misery; after witnessing the criminal exploitation of impeccable women; chauvinistically treating them as infinitesimal shit; in certain strata of even the 21st century,

It might be throbbing tirelessly in love; after witnessing the dream mate of its inborn choice; standing right infront of it and perennially kissing it with the sunshine of life,

It might be throbbing ardently in nostalgia; after witnessing those

same very places; those same very pinches of sacred soil; where it'd lived its entire childhood; gleefully cavorted behind the snow laden hills of time,

It might be throbbing wondrously in life; after witnessing those unending puffs of infallibly exultating breeze; that pricelessly infiltrated into the chest; every conceivable and unfurling instant of the day,

But throb as much as it might want for anybody; anything; anyplace on this spectacularly proliferating earth; if there was anyone who entirely ruled; governed and sat like an unshakable royal prince on every beat of my heart; then it was only the omnipresently blessing Almighty Creator.

Whether you choose to abominably dissect my orphaned

body—scientifically analyze and criticize each of its oblivious part; after my inevitably veritable and wholesomely uniting death,

And do whatever you choose after my veritable death—I really don't give a damn to even the most indescribably sinful of your actions O! parasitic man—but please do me just one ultimate favor of burying me in whatever form you have me after your mutilation-somewhere near the mosque of my Omnipotent Creator.

41. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LEAVE YOU O! GOD !

Like it was impossible for the Sun to leave the fathomless sky; ever dream of coming down to settle and snore on the earth; even once

during the tenure of its endlessly blazing lifetime,

Like it was impossible for the epitome to leave the towering mountain; ever dream of coming down to the ground and see ordinary sized human life; even once during the tenure of its unceasingly impenetrable lifetime,

Like it was impossible for immortal love to leave the passionately altruistic heart; ever dream of coming to the sadistically manipulative weighing machines of gold and silver; even once during the tenure of its perpetually blessed lifetime,

Like it was impossible for innocence to leave the uninhibitedly ordinary child; ever dream of coming to the mercilessly horn-rimmed glasses of the politician cum robotic business tycoon; even once during the tenure of its pricelessly undefeated lifetime,

42. THE MOSQUE OF MY OMNIPOTENT CREATOR.

Neither and ever infront of my very own mother; who'd borne me 9 excruciating months in her womb; compassionately safeguarding me even today; a 28 yrs later; against the most infinitesimal trace of the

devil,

Neither and ever infront of my very own father; who'd indefatigably worked round the clock; unsparingly abrading the heels of his soles against the merciless corporate tarmac; in order to lavishly attend to each of my minuscule needs,

Neither and ever infront of my very own sister; who'd herself undergone countless an ordeal; just in order to ensure that there always illuminated a smile on my face; and my parents as well as the world only looked at me,

Neither and ever infront of my very own grandmother; who'd astoundingly awakened several a time in the wee hours of midnight; to cater to my every eccentric demand; ecstatically run with my baby legs for unending a distance; with only the moon as savior and her ailing sight,

Neither and ever infront of my very own grandfather; who'd torrentially showered every conceivable gift on this planet upon my childish demands; many a time using droplets of his blood when his treasury of currency coin had disastrously exhausted,

Neither and ever infront of my very own brother; who'd never left a single stone unturned in his endless search for me; as I timelessly wandered in fantasy amidst a sea of humans; at every perceivable direction of sound,

Neither and ever infront of my very own uncle; who'd tirelessly spent every instant of his life; trying to keep me in the most euphoric of spirits; alleviate the inexplicable graves of depression that had sunk deep down into my soul,

Neither and ever infront of my very own aunt; who'd loved and adored

me more than her own children; proudly introducing me to her friends and the rest of the world; as the inimitable and very best,

Neither and ever infront of my very own pet; who'd wagged his tail more ardently than the fierily mid-day Sun; everytime the nimble sound of my intricate feet tinkered near his ever-alert ears,

Neither and ever infront of my very own shadow; who'd incorrigibly followed me since the first cry of ebullient life; unflinchingly agglutinated to me like a faithful soldier; irrespective of my sporadic moods and abuse,

Neither and ever infront of my very own niece; who'd virtually exhausted every of her rhapsodic effort; to mischievously transform each tear-drop that dribbled from my eye; into a fountain of perennially fructifying love,

Neither and ever infront of my very own cousin; who'd built countless a castle with me on the glistening sea shores; being always there as my best friend; when everyone else in the world had uncouthly abandoned me,

Neither and ever infront of my very own dwelling; who'd invincibly sequestered me from the most ferocious of maelstrom and disaster; infallibly braved the most extreme wilderness of the sadistic night; whilst I slept in its interiors like

an unparalleled crown prince,

Neither and ever infront of my very own neighbor; who'd arrived by my side at the faintest of my cry; be it in the wee hours of night or when atrocious bombs rained left-right-center in wartime; who turned up when some of my closest of blood-relations had deserted me,

Neither and ever infront of my very own heart; who'd perpetually stayed the closest to my inexplicably trembling chest; timelessly entwining every beat of my ordinarily destitute life with the spirit of immortal love,

Neither and ever infront of my very own daughter; who'd forever given me infinite reasons to smile and remain alive; with her divinely inarticulate mumbling; which knew no barriers of caste; creed; religion; status or tribe,

Neither and ever infront of my very own wife; who'd impregnably stood by my side in my times of good and bad; not inspiring me the slightest but yet and nevertheless resigning to her fate; and accepting me the way that I was,

But. If at all I wholeheartedly laughed; cried; sang; danced; joked; proliferated; sketched; poeticized; fantasized; liberated; evolved; adventured; slept; triumphed; flirted; wailed; whistled; lived and died; infront of somebody; then it was none else than the mosque of my Omnipotent Creator.

43. THE ONLY WAY TO ATTAIN GOD.

Yet. Simply no avail. As they all were eventually dragged to the land of inconsolably wailing hell; where they were made to pay an infinite times more; for each of their wickedly executed and indescribably dastardly sins,

Whilst the Omnipotent Creator wrote paradise for the newborn child even as it emanated its very first breath; as it spread its uninhibitedly miraculous palms to embrace all; irrespective of any religion; caste; creed or kind; into its unconquerable heaven of magically immortal love-Thereby apprizing infinite of its predecessors that the only way to attain God in totality was not "Blood and Sinful Sacrifice" but "Immortal Love".

The Omnipotent Creator Divine .

45. WITHOUT LIFE

Without him I was indeed a Sun; but without my fiery set of flamboyant rays,

Without him I was indeed a tree; but without my entire conglomerate of green leaves and resplendent petals,

Without him I was indeed a panther; but without my ferociously deafening roar,

Without him I was indeed a mammoth book; but without my grandiloquent set

of alphabets and words,

Without him I was indeed a fire; but without my dynamically sizzling repertoire of golden flames,

Without him I was indeed a cloud; but without my globules of life yielding and sparkling rain,

Without him I was indeed a house; but without my inevitable network of fortified doors and transparent windows,

Without him I was indeed a rose; but without my stupendously alluring perfume and Kingly redolence which I used to waft every second across this boundless Universe,

Without him I was indeed a car; but without my steering wheel; maneuvering wildly towards the valley of death as each moment unfurled by,

Without him I was indeed a butterfly; but without my hinges of opalescent wings; lying dilapidated in a remote heap; well cloistered away from blatant sight,

Without him I was indeed a desert; but without my glistening fleet of unsurpassable sands and the long line of ambling camels; which used to mark my existence,

Without him I was indeed a road; but without any direction; slithering helplessly on the ground; trying to search for my mooring under the devil's breath,

Without him I was indeed a diamond; but without my scintillating radiance

and tenaciously omnipotent shine,

Without him I was indeed a mouth; but without my speech and decaying in mute oblivion for the remainder of my tyrannized life,

Without him I was indeed an eye; but without my tears; staring lifelessly and for times greater than eternity into satanic space,

Without him I was indeed a stone; but without my ability to produce thunderous noise,

Without him I was indeed a clown; but without any ability to make people leap in ecstatic melody and leap,

Without him I was indeed a sleep; but without my dreams and unprecedented

realms of tantalizing fantasy,

Without him I was indeed a palm; but without my battalion of profoundly embossed and divinely destiny lines,

Without him I was indeed a heart; but without my overwhelming reservoir

of passionately palpitating beats,

Without him I was indeed a soul; but without my conscience or knowing the slightest about the spirit of my existence,

And without God I was simply a Man; who although appeared to be normally breathing on the streets; but was irrefutably shivering and without life .

46. GOD AND THE DEVIL

God was the colossal hive of sweet honey; while the minuscule bits of impurity in it was the gruesome devil,

God was the insurmountably ravishing eye; while the small traces of blindness in it was the ghastly devil,

God was the boundless ocean; while the adulterated bits of oil entrapped in it was the horrendous devil,

God was the fathomless river of crimson blood circulating in the body; while the disdainful infection lingering in it was the obnoxious devil,

was the deplorable devil,

God was the impeccable body of pearly white Moon; while the transient coat of clouds that pertinently kept obscuring it was the abominable devil,

God was anecdotes of astoundingly conjuring magic; while the moment it abruptly disappeared was the pernicious devil,

God was all the philanthropic humanity which immortally existed; while the sanctimonious religion it was bifurcated into was the despicable devil,

God was the harmoniously pouring out blissful sleep; while the abashing abuse scattered stingily in it was the savage devil,

And God was enigmatically beautiful life palpitating turbulently every minute; while the wickedly wandering mind inching towards unprecedented disaster; was the

diabolical devil .

47. THERE WAS NO MAN BORN PERFECT

There is no tree born on this earth which does not shed its leaves; remains inundated with complete foliage even in austere autumn and tumultuous storm,

There is no pond born on this earth which does not evaporate a trifle during blistering summer; swells towards the summit of the clouds even under fiery

rays of the Sun,

There is no road born on this earth which does not get sordid as vehicles pass by; regains its sparkling and virgin complexion even as truck loads of dust traverses in disdain,

There is no flower born on this earth which does not wither; blossoms perennially even in rampant massacre and thunderous rain,

There is no muscle born on this earth which does not dwindle; remains as bulging as the colossal mountain even as perilous and old age crept in,

There is no sound born on this earth which keeps on reverberating for decades on the trot; does not lower its decibel and intensity even an iota after emanating from the mouth,

There is no bird born on this earth which keeps on soaring incessantly in the air; without showing any signs of plummeting towards the ground; drifting off to blissful sleep,

There is no eye born on this earth which does not effusively cry; remains as stoical as white ice even in bizarre affliction and inexplicable distress,

There is no cheek born on this earth which does not blush; remains as morbid as the dead corpse even when voraciously tickled by the person whom it passionately loved,

There is no fist born on this earth which incessantly keeps punching to win mighty battles that came its way; remains as hard as obdurate stone even when viciously attacked by a battalion of bombs and acerbic sword,

There is no star born on this earth which keeps on shimmering even in dazzling daylight; tries to conquer even against the most blistering ray of the Sun,

There is no lip born on this earth which does not purse; remains as horrendous as sooty charcoal even when kissed blazingly by the person of its dreams,

There is no soil born on this earth which keeps on producing fathomless clusters of tantalizing fruit; doesn't succumb like infinite others in its fraternity to the

onslaught of uncouth drought,

There is no mouth born on this earth which does not yawn; keeps locked as tight as the prison door as each day unveils itself into chilly night,

There is no dog born on this earth which does not wag its bushy tail; remains dumb and impassive even after sighting its master,

There is no mosquito born on this earth which does not sting; rests as harmoniously as the immaculate angel even when surrounded by bodies of robust flesh and

rubicund demeanor,

There is no pen born on this earth which keeps on indefatigably writing; embosses volumes after volumes of books even after the last fraction of ink in its body is completely exhausted,

There is no mother born on this earth who does not care for her new born child; strangulates her baby; infact the very blood which she had painstakingly spawned,

And there is no man born on this earth who is absolutely perfect; achieving astronomical heights by the mere swish of his little finger; executing each aspect of life to envious perfection; and if indeed there is one such individual who actually had the power to metamorphose the entire Universe into enchanting paradise; then he wasn't even the slightest resemblance of man; for he was infact OMNIPRESENT GOD .

## 50. TO APPEASE THE ALMIGHTY CREATOR

No amount of wealth was enough to appease him; the boundless dungeons impregnated with glittering gold and silver; proved to be wholesomely futile,

No amount of cloth was enough to appease him; the colossal fields of blossoming cotton; the mountain of tenacious jute lying limp in the warehouses; proved to

be gruesomely useless,

No amount of literature was enough to appease him; the gargantuan bundles of spell binding history; the innumerable number of scriptures portraying legendary times proved to be of simply no use,

No amount of water was enough to appease him; the supremely colossal assemblage of salty ocean waters; every globule of liquid lying scattered on this earth; proved

to be overwhelmingly miserly,

No amount of sand was enough to appease him; the mammoth lands of the desert; the chunks of mud sprawled loosely all around the globe; proved to be infinitesimally incomplete to gain his attention,

No amount of ostentation was enough to appease him; the fathomless battalion of mermaids embellished with exotic flower buds; the fabulous perfume emanating in

abundance from their bodies proved to be a profoundly lost chance,

No amount of light was enough to appease him; the tremendously unsurpassable blazing island of Sun; the enormous festoon of artificial silvery rays; proved a

power too less to captivate his attention,

No amount of cars were enough to appease him; the entire fleet of swanky automobiles lines royally in front of the palace; every motorized engine loitering

on the trajectory of this planet; proved to be more minuscule than the red ant to grab his eyes,

No amount of speech was enough to appease him; the most eloquently woven sentences; the most delectable of voices floating in every cranny of the earth;

proved utterly hopeless to drift his intense concentration,

No amount of plants were enough to appease him; the entire outgrowth of the vivaciously wild jungle; the unprecedentedly huge garden of roses enticing all with

their fragrance; proved too wild to waver his Omnipotent nose,

No amount of power was enough to appease him; the Herculean strength in the bulging muscles of the boxer; the astronomical resilience that the entire township put up in coalition; proved more diminutive than the frigid straw in front of his Omniscient aura,

No amount of flattery was enough to appease him; the unsurpassable myriad of amicable phrases; infinite slaves kneeling down on his feet in meek obeisance;

proved too insipid to conjure his attention,

No amount of heroism was enough to appease him; the entire galaxy of brilliantly scintillating stars; ostentatiously dressed angels walking animatedly and in voluptuous twists on the ramp; proved to frivolous and morbid to evoke his tingling excitement,

No amount of color was enough to appease him; the stupendously vivid shades of the rainbow; the billions of grandiloquent paintings embossed on the cave walls;

proved too bland to match his irrefutably resplendent complexion,

No amount of space was enough to appease him; the vast expanse of azure blue sky; the incomprehensible winds of euphoric atmosphere; proved just a tiny whisker in

front of his invincible power,

No amount of victory was enough to appease him; the brutal assassination of millions to become the emperor; winning the mightiest of battle that came in

the way; proved too inconspicuous to lure his vision towards you,

No amount of seniority was enough too appease him; the entire ministry spear headed by the esteemed president; the government ruling the entire world;

proved too infinitesimal in front of his impregnable power,

No amount of bloodshed was enough to appease him; the innumerable anecdotes of indiscriminate slaughter; the uncouth slaining of innocent heads in the quest of

achieving territories beyond the greatest; proved an absolutely horrendous effort to try and make him wink,

And you didn't even have to emulate a sagacious saint or meditate incessantly in order to imprison his attention; Infact all one needed to do was to live harmoniously

in synergy with nature; propagate the virtue of immortal love to as far and distant as one could; spread the essence of equality in whomsoever one encountered; and then you would see it for yourself; that what the most biggest of things had failed to

have an impact; just a small little word called "Love", was enough in order to

appease the Almighty Creator.
